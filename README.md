# micronaut-runner-with-swagger-api

Project that supports swagger ui /openapi

Micronaut is super cool fwk with quick time startup 

It doesn't use reflection and heavy DI @ runtime like Spring boot that 

takes minutes to start the app. 

Very suited for microservices in K8s, docker.


Dependency Injection is done at compile time, infact many other operations
